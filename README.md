Mini Project 2 from RISE program batch BDA04.

Introduction <br>
Cookie Cats is a popular mobile puzzle game where players complete a task and level up. <br>
While players completes levels, they encounter gates after completing certain number of levels.<br>
Gates force players to wait for sometime before they can play further or make in game purchases.<br>
<br>
Business Problem <br>
Even though Cookie Cats overall popularity is growing over time with players subscribing to try out the game, but:<br>
-Revenue from in-game purchases has been declining over time.<br>
-Total number of active players are also declining with players uninstalling the game after playing for few days.<br>
<br>
Business Objective <br> Increase YoY revenue from game purchases by increasing retention rate of gamers.<br>
Hypothesis: <br>
• Company CEO believes that players are churning because the first gate encountered at level 30 is too early which
forces players to wait before they can proceed further in the game.<br>
• In order to increase player retention rate, developers ran AB-test by moving the first gate from level 30 to level 40 for some players.
i.e., group A would encounter the gate at level 30 and group B would encounter the gate at level 40<br>
<br>
Analytics Objective<br> 
Test CEO's hypothesis to analyze if moving the first gate from level 30 to 40 increases retention rate and number of game rounds played.<br>
